# Overview

* Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR)
* Microsoft built a new Runtime on top of the CLR to support DLRs. 
    * Not only does the DLR allow languages like Ruby and Python to execute code on the .NET Runtime, but it also allow statically typed languages like C# to pick up some dynamic language features.
