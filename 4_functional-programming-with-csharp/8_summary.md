# Summary

* Functions are perfect abstraction for programming  in the small
* Treat functions as data
* Also see: "LINQ - Beyond Queries" at pluralsight.com

* The Task Parallel Library (TPL) is a very functional oriented API, there are others like in Silverlight programming or Asynchronously Web Services calls - where there are APIs that allow you to pass callback functions in and have that call back invoked when a remote call is complete.
