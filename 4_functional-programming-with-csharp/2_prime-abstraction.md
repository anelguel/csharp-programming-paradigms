# Prime Abstraction

* Method = Function
* Small, focused abstractions are the most powerful of all abstractions, because they are easy to understand, modify and reuse
* Functions also have some innate abilities, like the ability to run asyncronously or run in parallel, the ability to be lazy and the ability to be composable
