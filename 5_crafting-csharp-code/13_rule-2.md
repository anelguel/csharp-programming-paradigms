# Rule 2 - Keep Methods Short

* The more lines, the hard to understand. How many is too many? That's a question that an only be answered in context. It depends on what the method is doing, although 20 lines may be pushing it. Rule of thumb is that 1-10 is generally safe. 10-20 may need a quick check to make sure it's okay.
* Over 30, may be worth revisiting. 50-60 could very well be a problem.
* Can it be divided into different methods?
