# On Naming

Quick recap:
* camelCase
* PascalCase
* snake_case
* kebab-case

* Use Pascal case for method names
* Trim : removes or trims the whitespace from the start and the end of a string
* `var` is still strongly typed. In the example provided, `var` implies that you're more concerned with meaningful names and the requirements, than the type names and complier rules
* Be introspective of your own code, does it convey meaning?
