# The Big Encapsulation

* One of the underappreciated perspectives in object oriented design in not defining classes to encapsulate code - that's easy - but in defining classes to separate roles and responsibilities.
     * A great resource on this perspective is Rebecca Wirfs Brock's book titled Object Design: Roles and Responbilities and Collaborations.
     * Focuses on knowing, deciding, and doing in code. http://www.wirfs-brock.com
* One thing to focus on (taken from the book above) is object responsiblities. What objects are responsible for knowing things? What objects are responsible for deciding things? And what objects are responsible for doing things?
    * If you can keep these responsibilities separated, it will go a long way to building abstractions that are flexible and easier to understand.
