# Summary

* Modern object oriented programming (OOP) using encapsulation and polymorphism, but inheritance is limited and instead, modern OOP embraces interface based programming and delegation as a means for code reuse.
* Even though modern OOP build small and focused classes, they are still extensible thanks to delegation and polymorphism.


Other notes:
* Encapsulation is king
* Delegation reuses code, too
* Small abstraction are powerful abstractions
